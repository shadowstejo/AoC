dreinull.py is a script for a geocache called md5sum in Hannover.
it uses a slightly modified md5sum implementation from rosetta code.
The main-part is fully self-written and checks through 2 interlooped loops and compares the modified md5sum to the given cypher-code.
If both fit, the two names plus the final coordinates are output. 
The two names are a bonus for the log which is written on the geocaching-page.

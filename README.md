# AoC
Currently working on Advent of Code 2022. 
A small selection of 2020 and 2015 exists too. 

It was supposed to be my repo for only AoC but turned into a collection of interesting projects.

Additionally I added some interesting projects I wrote as part of assignments at Leibniz University Hannover during WinterSemester 2020/2021.
Also one of my first Projects I wrote: schaltjahr.cpp

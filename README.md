# AoC
2020 Advent of Code
A few days of the first weeks of Advent of Code.
It was supposed to be my repo for only AoC but turned into a collection of interesting projects.

Additionally I added some interesting projects I wrote as part of assignments at Leibniz University Hannover during WinterSemester 2020/2021.
Also one of my first Projects i wrote: schaltjahr.cpp
